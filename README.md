Enhancing YOLOv5 using APDC and PEA Attention
Overview

This project enhances the performance of YOLOv5 by integrating Accurate Positioning Deformable Convolution (APDC) and Positional Enhancement Attention (PEA) modules.
The objective is to improve feature localization, spatial awareness, and detection accuracy, particularly for small and complex objects.

Key Contributions

Accurate Positioning Deformable Convolution (APDC):
Improves spatial sampling flexibility by enabling adaptive receptive fields, allowing the network to better capture geometric variations and object boundaries.

Positional Enhancement Attention (PEA):
Strengthens positional information in feature maps, enabling improved localization and enhanced representation of spatial relationships.

Improved YOLOv5 architecture:
Integration of APDC and PEA modules into the backbone and neck for better multi-scale feature learning.

Enhanced detection performance compared to baseline YOLOv5.

Applications

Aerial object detection

Autonomous driving

Surveillance systems
